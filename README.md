## Web Application

### `npm install`
Install all the package dependencies.<br/>

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open (http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Hardware Module

The Hardware Setup of the project is based on a NodeMCU Board, which is nothing but an ESP8266 WiFi Module. The Module is configured to measure 4 Vital Parameters inclusive of:

- BPM (number of beats (contractions) of the heart per minute)
- SPO2 (Dissolved Oxygen in Body)
- Blood Pressure (Both Systolic and Diastolic Parameters)
- Temperature

In the absence of sensors due to movement restrictions, currently we are emulating data with Random Values being generated within specified limits. Data can also be generated by emulating a Potentiometer since all the sensors we'd naturally use in the device typically produce an output voltage proportional to the absolute temperature, with very good accuracy and sensitivity. 

The measured values are sent to our Database using a POST Request to the URL specified, after the device connects to WiFi.

The Program is written in C++.

### To Run The Module

- Download the Code from the link below.   
[Download Code](NodeMCU/NodeMCU.ino)
- Add the Connection SSID and Password you'd want the device to connect to.
- Change the UID of the device as currently it is hardcoded to "a".
- Upload the Code to a NodeMCU Board.
- No need to attach any sensor as Data is being emulated automatically and will be POSTed as soon as Connection is established.
